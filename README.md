# unit-4-game
In this game a player chooses a crystal by clicking on it. For each game there is a new value between 1 and 12 assigned to each of the crystals. The point of the game is to use the crystals in a strategic way which adds up to the random number generated for that game. If the player's current score matches the game number, then the player wins and the game resets after one second. If the player's current score exceeds the game number, then the player loses and the game resets after one second.
